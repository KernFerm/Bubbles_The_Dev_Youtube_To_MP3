## Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg Not Found**: If you see the message `FFmpeg is not installed or not found in PATH`, please ensure that `ffmpeg` is installed and correctly added to your PATH.

## Notes
- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and added to your system PATH so pydub can locate it.
- If installed with winget, ffmpeg may be located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links`.
