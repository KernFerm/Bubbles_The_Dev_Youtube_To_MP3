# Bubbles The Dev Youtube To MP3 Downloader

This Python script downloads audio from a YouTube video URL or playlist and converts it to MP3 files at 192 kbps. It utilizes the `yt-dlp` library for downloading, `pydub` for audio conversion, and `mutagen` for embedding metadata.

## Features

- Downloads audio from a YouTube video or playlist.
- Converts the audio to MP3 files with a bitrate of 192 kbps.
- Embeds metadata (title, artist, album) into the MP3 files.
- Automatically checks if `ffmpeg` is installed and configures its path for `pydub`.
- Cleans up temporary files after conversion.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.11 [Python 3.11.6 Installer](https://github.com/KernFerm/Py3.11.6installer)
- **ffmpeg** (must be installed and added to PATH)
- **Python packages**:
  - `yt-dlp`
  - `pydub`
  - `mutagen`

## Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg Not Found**: If you see the message `FFmpeg is not installed or not found in PATH`, please ensure that `ffmpeg` is installed and correctly added to your PATH.
- **Metadata Not Embedded**: Ensure the `.info.json` files are being generated by `yt-dlp` and the script has write access to the output directory.

---

## Notes

- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and added to your system PATH so `pydub` can locate it.
- If installed with `winget`, `ffmpeg` may be located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links`.
